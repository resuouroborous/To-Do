- User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive layout with a helpful message when all tasks are completed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- This project was built using fundamental web technologies, with no external frameworks or libraries.
- HTML5: For the structure and content of the application.
- CSS3: For all custom styling, layout, and responsive design using media queries.
- Vanilla JavaScript: For all the application logic, including:
- DOM Manipulation (Creating, updating, and deleting elements)
- Event Handling (Listening for form submissions and button clicks)
- Local Storage API (Saving and retrieving tasks)

## üìñ Key Learnings
- This project was a great opportunity to solidify core JavaScript concepts and front-end development patterns:
- State Management: The entire application is driven by a single "source of truth"‚Äîa JavaScript array of task objects. The UI is simply a function that renders this state.
- Data Persistence: Learned how to use localStorage to save and retrieve data, making for a much better user experience than an app that resets on every page load.
- DOM Manipulation: Gained extensive practice creating, modifying, and removing HTML elements dynamically in response to user actions.
- Event Delegation: Implemented a more efficient event handling pattern by placing a single event listener on the parent list rather than on every individual button.
- Responsive CSS: Practiced building a mobile-first design and using CSS media queries to create a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
